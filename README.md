This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Notes:
This app uses Node.js, and npm (node packet manager).
Make sure to install the latest stable versions to your computer.

##To modify this application you need:
Visual Studio Code or some other code editor.  
Visual Studio Code is free to download and install.

##To run this application you need to follow these steps:
1.) Download the Zip from my repository.
2.) Extract all files to a new folder.
3.) In the command-line navigate to the folder extracted from my repository by using "cd".
4.) Create the "node_modules" folder. It is needed to run the app and can be created running, ==> npm install .
5.) Then run ==> npm start .
6.) A message in console will read: Server started at http://localhost:8081 (possibly another number).
7.) Navigate to the URL mentioned in Step 6.) to see the website served by Node.js.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
